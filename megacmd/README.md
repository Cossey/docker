## Container Configuration

| Name     | Description                                                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| USERNAME | The mega account username. *Required if SESSION not supplied.*                                               |
| PASSWORD | The mega account password. *Required if SESSION not supplied.*                                               |
| SESSION  | The mega login session. *Required if USERNAME and PASSWORD not supplied.*                                    |
| MEGACMD  | The command to pass to the megacmd program. You don't need to prefix the `mega-` to the command. *Required.* |
| INTERVAL | The time in minutes to repeat the command. Leave blank or set to 0 exit immediately.                         |
| BEGIN    | The time in HHMM UTC to first run the command. If not set will run immediately.                              |
| DV       | Run delete versions command after each MEGACMD with the supplied path.                                       |

> You can add `_FILE` to the end of any environment variable to set the variable from a file. Typically used for secrets.

If the `BEGIN` command is set, then the `INTERVAL` will be set to 1440 (one day) automatically. If you want to override this then set `INTERVAL` to the delay you want (you can also set it to `0` to exit immediately).

## Usage

To run help (one-off)
```
docker run -d \
-e USERNAME=<yourmegausername> \
-e PASSWORD=<yourmegapassword> \
-e MEGACMD=help \
kosdk/megacmd
```

To upload a folder every day from the host machine
```
docker run -d \
-v /backup:/hostpathtofolder
-e SESSION=<sessionid> \
-e INTERVAL=1440
-e MEGACMD="put /backup/* /backup/server/" \
kosdk/megacmd
```

## Session IDs

It is recommended to use the `SESSION_FILE` environment variable to read a session secret from docker secrets/file instead of exposing your username and password.

To generate a session id, you can run the container with following:
```
docker run --rm \
-e USERNAME=<yourusername> \
-e PASSWORD=<yourpassword> \
-e MEGACMD="session" \
kosdk/megacmd
```
You will see the session secret in the output.
